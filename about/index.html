        <h2>A Little Bit About My Love For Pokemon</h2>
        <p>My love for pokemon all started when I first got pokemon Ruby as a kid for Iranian New Year for my game boy advance. As a kid, that was all I wanted and I played that game religously.
          I played that game everywhere, at school, during recess and when I was supposed to be learning. They had to physically remove it from my hands to stop me from playing. And when I wasn't
          playing, I was watching tapes of the reruns of the cartoon on tape. Now after 17 years of not playing pokemon, PokemonGO has rekindled my love for the game and that world and it been magical ever since.
          Now if you have reached this point of the text, I would like to let you know all of the above is bullshit. While yes I did watch Pokemon and played PokemonGo later, I never was apart of that fandom of Pokemon,
          I was more of Yu-gi-oh kid growing up. I just wanted some filler text that is probably littered with grammatical mistakes. Sorry...
